Jupyter notebooks and python codes including the analyses for the results and figures in Oldeman et al. (2024) - revisions sent to WCD on 24 January 2024.

These codes are used to analyse output of coupled climate model CCSM4-Utr (netcdf format), specifically simulations E280, E560, Eoi280 and Eoi400 (more info in Baatsen et al. (2022), Climate of the Past), as well as reanalysis data from the 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR) version 3 by NOAA/CIRES/DOE. Analysis is limited to January monthly mean data. 

- paper_figures.ipynb includes all processing of the data, analysis of the data and subsequent production of the figures in the paper and the supplement.
- defs.py includes all functions and definitions used in the analyses.
